## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

This mod replaces default UI elements and colors of Voicemeeter by hooking certain Windows API and Voicemeeter functions responsible for drawing on the application window surface.

It creates a copy of the Voicemeeter executable and patches its import table so that it loads the mod DLL on start-up, which performs the theme initialization.

[Supported themes](#-supported-themes) are placed in the `Documents/Voicemeeter/themes` directory and consist of bitmap images for the UI elements and a single `.yaml` file for color mappings.
Themes can be easily created, modified and adapted using regular image editing software.

### Files

#### vmtheme32.dll | vmtheme64.dll

Contains the core functionality of theme initialization by hooking theming related functions using the [Microsoft Detours library](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours).
It is copied to the `C:\Program Files (x86)\VB\Voicemeeter` directory and loaded by Voicemeeter on every start-up.

#### addimport32.exe | addimport64.exe

Patches the import table of the Voicemeeter executable by adding an entry for `vmtheme32.dll` / `vmtheme64.dll`. This is only done once, when you run the patching script. Voicemeeter will from then on load the DLL when it starts.

#### vmtheme_patcher.ps1

Runs `addimport32.exe` and `addimport64.exe` to patch the 32bit and 64bit version of the Voicemeeter executable of your choice (Default, Banana, Potato).
It creates a new executable with `_vmtheme` suffix and only patches this copy (i.e. if you select "Potato", it creates `voicemeeter8_vmtheme.exe` and `voicemeeter8x64_vmtheme.exe`).
It then copies `vmtheme32.dll` and `vmtheme64.dll` into the Voicemeeter installation directory.

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

### I have problems using this, can I go to the Voicemeeter Discord / forum and ask for help there?

No, this is a completely unofficial mod that is not affiliated with Voicemeeter or VB-Audio Software in any shape or form, the moderators won't be able to help you, see [Support](#-support). 

### How does it work?

It patches the Voicemeeter executable so that it loads the mod DLL on start-up. The mod then hooks (= intercepts) some Windows API functions responsible for drawing on the application surface. This includes: [CreatePen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createpen), [CreateBrushIndirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createbrushindirect) and [SetTextColor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-settextcolor), among others. It also hooks a specific function in order to swap out the background bitmap.
Hooking is done using the Microsoft Detours library: https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/wiki

### Does it modify the Voicemeeter executable on disk?

It doesn't modify or delete the original executable. It creates a copy with `_vmtheme` appended to its name that loads the mod when executed.

### I have Voicemeeter configured to run on Windows startup, how can I autostart Voicemeeter with the theme applied?

#### Option 1

Create a backup of the original executable and rename the mod executable by removing the `_vmtheme` suffix.

#### Option 2

1. Untick `Run on Windows Startup` in the Voicemeeter menu
2. Create a shortcut to the mod executable in `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

### Does this mod give me a themed Voicemeeter on it's own?

No, this mod only enables theme support. You also need to download a supported theme separately, see [Supported themes](#-supported-themes).
         
### How do I make my own theme?

Get a [supported theme](#-supported-themes) and edit the bitmaps with image editing software. You'll also need to adapt the color mapping in the `colors.yaml` file to match the background bitmaps.
If you want the original background images embedded in the Voicemeeter executable, you need to extract them yourself, as described in [this guide I wrote on the official Voicemeeter Discord](https://discord.com/channels/755690270795890739/1369370435187380304).
